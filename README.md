# IssueTracker

This is a self made project recommended by others in the industry.
The project focuses on making a bug/issue tracker that can be used to keep track of issues within a project.
It uses an Amazon Web Service(AWS) to authenticate and host a relational database on the cloud.
Using MYSQL it has the ability to add, update, and search records within the tracker.

This project was fun and new as it allowed me to explore the QT IDE and its UI functionality.
The UI uses an XML style format to translate onto the screen. Simple forms are used to manipulate the XML code
in order to keep it streamlined with the program.
